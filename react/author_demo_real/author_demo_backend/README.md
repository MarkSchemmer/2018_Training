# Author_demo

Is a Pluralsight demo sight, mainly I took the idea of the website and implemented the site myself.<br />
In this small full-scale web app, I did **CRUD** operations and as well I implemented the full flux archetecture<br />


There is a demo(**demo.mp4**) of what the app does in the repo, open in a video player to view.

The technologies that I used in this project : 

* For the boilerplate code I used ```react-create-app``` CLI
* NodeJs
* ExpressJs
* ReactJs
* React Router
* Axios
* Flux
* MongoDb and Mongoose
